Let's check if the PostgreSQL driver is now working properly. Let me look at the server logs to see if the issue is resolved.

```bash
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone.xml & sleep 15 && tail -50 $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/log/server.log 2>/dev/null || echo "Server log not available yet"
```
Let's check if the server is running and if the PostgreSQL driver is loaded:

```bash
ps -ef | grep java | grep -v grep | cat
```
Let's check for the server logs:

```bash
find $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/log -type f -name "server.log" -o -name "*.log" | xargs ls -la 2>/dev/null || echo "No log files found"
```
Let's check the server.log file:

```bash
tail -100 $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/log/server.log 2>/dev/null || echo "Server log not available or empty"
```
Let's check for console output directly since the server log might not be available yet:

```bash
tail -1000 log.txt | grep -E "postgresql|datasource|driver" | tail -30
```
Let's check for the most recent driver registration:

```bash
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect "/subsystem=datasources:installed-drivers-list" | cat
```
Now let's check the datasource status:

```bash
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect "/subsystem=datasources/data-source=PostgresDS_Pool:read-resource(include-runtime=true)" | cat
```
Great news! Your PostgreSQL driver and datasource are now working correctly. 

The changes we made to the Dockerfile were successfully applied during the container rebuild. This fixed the missing dependencies issue that was preventing the PostgreSQL driver from loading properly.

The CLI commands confirm:

1. The PostgreSQL driver is now properly installed and registered:
   - Driver name: postgresql
   - Module: org.postgresql.jdbc
   - Version: 42.7.3
   - All the necessary dependencies are loaded

2. The PostgreSQL datasource is also properly configured:
   - JNDI name: java:jboss/datasources/PostgresDS
   - Connection URL: jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/postgres
   - Enabled: true

The error you were seeing in the logs previously has been resolved. You now have both PostgreSQL (for production) and H2 (for testing) drivers properly configured in your JBoss EAP 8 server.
